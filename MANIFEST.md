# installer.json, format 1

The manifest sits at the root of the module folder and declares everything the
installer puts in place, and therefore everything it looks for and removes.
The installer checks it in full before touching anything: a missing key, a
malformed row or a file missing from the package stops it with a message that
names the problem.

Paths inside the package are relative to the module folder, with `/`.

## Keys

| Key | Required | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `format` | yes | `"wow-mods-installer/1"` |
| `module` | yes | name of the module folder under `modules/` in the server sources (letters, digits, `_`, `.`, `-`); the name its receipts carry |
| `title` | no | display name |
| `server_module` | no | `false`: a package without server module, see below (`true` by default) |
| `fields` | yes | the folders the module needs, required or optional, see below |
| `signature` | yes, unless `server_module` is `false` | package files that identify the module: a folder of `modules/` that contains all of them is the module, whatever its name |
| `exclude_from_sources` | no | package folders or files not copied into `modules/` (client data, for instance); `.git` and `__pycache__` never are |
| `configuration` | no | the module's `.conf`, see below |
| `lua` | no | the module's Lua scripts, see below |
| `shared` | no | components several modules carry, such as the workbench, see below |
| `dbc` | no | the module's DBC rows, see below |
| `game_files` | no | files written into the game archives, see below |
| `addons` | no | addon folders copied into the game's `Interface\AddOns`, see below |
| `backups` | no | suffixes of backup files left by older tools (e.g. `".avant_item_upgrade"`), deleted on removal |
| `database` | no | what the module leaves in the database, see below |

The SQL files are not declared: they are the `.sql` files under the folders
of the module's `data/sql` whose name holds the database's name
(`data/sql/db-world`, `data/sql/world`; `db-characters`, `characters`), which
the core updater applies on the next start, sorted by file name. When
`Updates.EnableDatabases` in `worldserver.conf` disables the updater for a
database, the installer applies them itself, in the same order. The updater
records files by name only: prefix every SQL file name with the module name.
A package without server module has no module for the updater: the installer
always applies its SQL itself.

The AzerothCore module loader must be named after the folder:
`Add<module, with - replaced by _>Scripts`.

### fields

```json
"fields": {
  "game": "required",
  "worldserver": { "optional": "Only if you run the server: adds 18 statistics. Leave empty if you only play." },
  "mysql": { "optional": "Only with the worldserver folder. Found by itself when left empty." }
}
```

The folders the module needs besides its own: `game` (the folder of
`Wow.exe`), `worldserver` (the folder of `worldserver.exe`), `sources` (the
AzerothCore sources) and `mysql` (`mysql.exe`). Each is `"required"`, or
`{"optional": "<why>"}`: the window shows required fields in one panel and
optional ones in another, each with its reason. A field left out is of no use
to the module: the window does not show it, and the installer does not read
it.

Each field must match the rest of the manifest, or the manifest is refused:

| Field | Declared exactly when | Optional |
|---|---|---|
| `game` | the module has `game_files`, `addons` or client DBC rows | never |
| `worldserver` | a server module, server DBC rows, or `database` | for a package without server module: left empty, the server part is left out (see below) |
| `sources` | a server module | never |
| `mysql` | a server module, or `database` | exactly when `worldserver` is |

`sources` and `mysql` are found by themselves when left empty (the build
folder's `CMakeCache.txt`; `worldserver.conf`, the PATH, MySQL Server's
folder).

The four kinds of modules:

| Module | `game` | `worldserver` | `sources` | `mysql` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| client only (an addon) | required | | | |
| server or client (ForeverUI) | required | optional | | optional |
| server and client | required | required | required | required |
| server only | | required | required | required |

### configuration

```json
"configuration": {
  "file": "attriboost.conf",
  "template": "conf/attriboost.conf.dist",
  "values": { "Attriboost.Enable": "1" }
}
```

`template` is copied as is into `configs/modules/<file>.dist`, and into
`configs/modules/<file>` with each setting of `values` replaced (each must
exist in the template).

### lua

```json
"lua": {
  "folder": "Attriboost",
  "files": ["data/lua/Attriboost_Serveur.lua", "data/lua/Attriboost_Client.lua"],
  "config_path": { "file": "Attriboost_Serveur.lua", "variable": "CONF" }
}
```

The files go into `<scripts>/<folder>`, where `<scripts>` is `ALE.ScriptPath`
of `mod_ale.conf` (or `Eluna.ScriptPath` of `mod_eluna.conf`), `lua_scripts`
by default. With `config_path`, the line `local CONF = "..."` of that file
receives the path of the module's `.conf`, relative to the worldserver folder.

`sources` (in place of `files`, or with them): package folders whose tree is
copied into `<scripts>/<folder>` (`"sources": ["data/lua/SphereGrid"]`);
`config_path` then names the file by its path in that tree.

On removal, the files of `files` are removed wherever they are under
`<scripts>`, those of `sources` at their place in the folder; the folder is
removed if nothing else is left in it (the files a user saved there stay, and
so does the folder).

### shared

```json
"shared": [{
  "folder": "Workbench",
  "source": "data/lua/Workbench",
  "version_file": "VERSION",
  "provider_mark": "Workbench.Register(",
  "database": { "world": { "rows": [{ "table": "gameobject_template", "where": "entry = 810000" }] } }
}]
```

A component several modules ship as an identical copy. `source` is copied into
`<scripts>/<folder>` unless the copy there has the same or a higher version
(the whole number in `version_file`, `VERSION` by default); an older copy is
replaced. The component is no trace of the module. On removal, once the
module's own scripts are gone, it stays while a `.lua` or `.ext` file of the
scripts folder, outside its own folder, holds `provider_mark`; otherwise its
folder is deleted and its `database` rows too (`rows` only, same form as in
`database`). A removal of leftovers never touches it.

### dbc

One entry per DBC file:

| Key | Content |
|---|---|
| `file` | file name, e.g. `"Spell.dbc"` (`DBFilesClient\Spell.dbc` in the game) |
| `fields` | number of fields; a file with another count stops the installer (unexpected client version) |
| `text_fields` | indices of the string fields, or `[first, last]` ranges |
| `client` | `true`: the rows of `rows`; a package path: a reduced DBC that holds only the module's rows; `false` or absent: the game is not touched |
| `server` | same, for the server file in `<DataDir>/dbc` |
| `rows` | with `true`: one row per element, either an object `{"index": value}` whose missing fields are 0 or the empty string, or a full list; field 0 is the identifier |

`text_fields` must list **every** string field of the file, used by the
module or not: rows are compared by content, strings as text, and a string
field read as a number would never match.

A few files hold byte fields besides 4-byte ones (`SpellChainEffects.dbc`: 48
fields in 177 bytes). Their rows are read as 4-byte words followed by the
bytes left over; `fields` is still the count of the file's header, the rows
come from a reduced DBC, and a text field must be one of the words.

On install, the server file gets the rows appended. On the game side, the file
is read from the archive the game reads it from and written, rows appended,
into the archive the game reads last (`Data\patch-Z.MPQ`, or
`patch-xxXX-Z.MPQ` of the language folder for ruRU, zhCN and zhTW; see the
README). On removal, the rows go, and so do the strings the install appended
at the end of the file.

### game_files

```json
"game_files": {
  "sources": ["data/art"],
  "owned_folders": ["Interface/Attriboost"]
}
```

`sources`: package folders whose tree is the game's tree
(`data/art/Interface/Attriboost/x.blp` is `Interface\Attriboost\x.blp`). The
files are written into the archive the game reads last, like the DBC files.
A file that archive already holds is left alone and is not the module's.

`extensions` (optional): only the files of `sources` with these extensions
are written (`[".blp", ".m2"]`); previews or notes kept beside them stay out.

`owned_folders`: game folders (at least two levels) that only the module
uses: whatever a custom archive holds in them is the module's.

`replaces` (optional): files or folders of the module's game files that
replace ON PURPOSE the version another custom archive provides (a pack of
the player's, for instance): `["Interface/Glues/Models"]`. Such a file is no
conflict: it is written into the archive the game reads last, which shadows
the other version without touching it, and on removal the other version is
what the game reads again. It is still a conflict when the other version sits
in that very archive, since writing would overwrite it. Each entry must name
at least one of the module's game files.

### addons

```json
"addons": ["data/addon/ForeverUI"]
```

Package folders copied as they are into `Interface\AddOns` of the game folder
(`Interface\AddOns\ForeverUI`); each holds the `.toc` named after it. On
removal the folder is deleted.

### Package without server module

With `"server_module": false`, the package is for the game, with a server
part: the installer writes its game files and its addons, adds its DBC rows
(game side, and server side for the entries whose `server` is set), and
applies its SQL itself. Nothing goes into the server's sources, configuration
or Lua scripts, and the server needs no rebuild. `signature`,
`exclude_from_sources`, `configuration`, `lua` and `shared` are refused;
`database` holds `rows` only, and SQL in `data/sql` for a database needs its
`rows`, so that removal deletes what the SQL adds. The worldserver folder
gives the server DBC folder and the databases, and nothing is written while
the worldserver runs.

With `worldserver` optional in `fields`, the worldserver folder may be left
empty: a player who does not run the server. Only the game part then goes in: game
files, addons, and the DBC entries without a `server` side. The server part
(DBC entries with a `server` side, on both sides, and the SQL) is left out.
A removal without the worldserver folder takes what the game holds; when the
game held rows of the server part, it says to run the installer again with
the worldserver folder, to remove the server DBC rows and database rows.

### database

```json
"database": {
  "characters": {
    "before": [{ "if_column": "attriboost_attributes.talentpoints", "sql": "UPDATE characters c JOIN ..." }],
    "tables": ["attriboost_attributes"],
    "rows": [{ "table": "character_aura", "where": "spell IN ({ids:Spell.dbc})" },
             { "table": "updates", "where": "name IN ({sql_files:db-characters})" }]
  },
  "world": {
    "rows": [{ "table": "spell_dbc", "where": "ID IN ({ids:Spell.dbc})" }]
  }
}
```

| Key | Content |
|---|---|
| `tables` | tables that belong to the module: dropped on removal |
| `rows` | rows of shared tables: deleted on removal (`DELETE FROM <table> WHERE <where>`) |
| `before` | statements run before the deletions, each only if the column `if_column` exists; e.g. giving back points before the table that counts them is dropped |

Order on removal: `characters`, then `world`; in each, `before`, `rows`,
`tables`. Tables that do not exist are skipped.

Placeholders in `where` and `sql`:

| Placeholder | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `{ids:File.dbc}` | the identifiers of that `dbc` entry, client and server, comma-separated |
| `{sql_files:db-world}` | the quoted names of every `.sql` file under `data/sql/db-world` (the names the updater records in `updates`); same for any folder of `data/sql` |

An empty list becomes `NULL`.

## Presence, conflicts, receipts

What proves the module is there, and what only carries its identifiers:

| Proves the module is there | Carries its identifiers without proof |
|---|---|
| a folder of `modules/` named `module` or holding every `signature` file | |
| its `.conf` or `.conf.dist`; its Lua files; its Lua folder holding nothing else | |
| a server DBC row identical to the module's | a server DBC row with the same identifier and other content |
| a receipt in a custom archive | |
| a client DBC row identical to the module's, or named by the receipt | a client DBC row with the same identifier and other content (Blizzard's rows included) |
| a game file named by the receipt, or under an owned folder | a game file the game reads, from a custom archive, in another version (unless listed in `replaces`) |
| an addon folder of the module in `Interface\AddOns` | |
| a backup | |
| a module table; a row of `updates` | a row of another shared table |

Any proof: the run removes everything that is the module's, shared-table rows
included; rows and files that only carry its identifiers stay. Nothing but
identifiers: conflict, no install; the user may declare them leftovers, and
the database rows and DBC rows go (game files never do).

In each archive it writes to, the installer leaves a receipt,
`WoW-mods\<module>.receipt`, listing what it put there (`file <name>`,
`dbc <File.dbc> <ids>`, and `added <File.dbc>` for a DBC file it copied whole
into an archive that had none). On removal, such a copy goes too once its rows
are out, if it says again what the game reads below it. An archive left empty,
or holding only DBC files identical to the ones the game would read without
it, is deleted.
